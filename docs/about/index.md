## FAQs

### Why "Custcodian"?

Minder is kind of a Code Custodian, and I wanted something that was unique when you Googled it.  Also, I'm bad at names.  If you want to suggest a really awesome name, I might change the company name, and send you a pile of swag when I get some made.  Otherwise, "custcodian" it is.

### What's your pricing?  I'm allergic to "contact us for a sales pitch".

For public repos, the [cloud-hosted instance](/hosted) is free.  For private repos, I currently have a single tier -- $500/year, or $50/month, for up to 60 private repos.  If there's interest and demand, I'll work on a full pricing structure, but my current focus is improving Minder rather than fancy business things.

### Why not run Minder on my own?

Go ahead!  I'll even be happy to answer questions on OpenSSF Slack (`#minder`).  On the other hand, paying me means that I'll be more likely to work on enhancements, and it will help me cover the hosting bills.
