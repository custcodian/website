## FAQs

### Why "Custcodian"?

Minder is kind of a Code Custodian, and I wanted something that was unique when you Googled it.  Also, I'm bad at names.  If you want to suggest a really awesome name, I might change the company name, and send you a pile of swag when I get some made.  Otherwise, "Custcodian" it is.

### What's your pricing?  I'm allergic to "contact us for a sales pitch".

For public repos, the [cloud-hosted instance](/hosted) is free.  For private repos, I currently have a single tier -- $500/year, or $50/month, for up to 60 private repos.  If there's interest and demand, I'll work on a full pricing structure, but my current focus is improving Minder rather than fancy business things.

### What about a GUI (web UI)?

The current UI for Stacklok Cloud is not open source.  I'm planning to develop a new UI in the next month or so for Custcodian -- I expect that the UI will _probably_ be open-source, but since I'm still in the design phase, I might discover reasons for it not to be.  If you're interested in collaborating on a web UI, drop me a note and you can probably influence the plans.

### Why not run Minder on my own?

Go ahead!  I'll even be happy to answer questions on [OpenSSF Slack](http://slack.openssf.org/) ([`#minder`](https://openssf.slack.com/archives/C07SP9RSM2L)).  On the other hand, paying me means that I'll be more likely to work on enhancements, and it will help me cover the hosting bills.
