# Custcodian Services

We're happy to chat about custom services related to Minder.

## On-Premises Hosting

While some users may prefer our [cloud-hosted instance](/hosted), others may prefer to implement their own Minder instance on their own corporate-managed infrastructure.  This is a cost-benefit tradeoff, and there are no "right" answers.  We'd be happy to help with an initial proof-of-concept trial, a production implementation of Minder (including any customization needed for your enterprise), or ongoing support and maintenance of Minder installations.

## Profile and Policy Development

As experts in Minder policy development, we're happy to discuss how you can use Minder to enforce your organization's policies.  Some examples of previous work we've done:

- **OpenSSF Baseline**: [Verify that released artifact licenses match an OSI or FSF-approved license](https://github.com/mindersec/minder-rules-and-profiles/blob/main/security-baseline/rule-types/github/osps-le-04.yaml)
- **GitHub Actions Security**: [Verify that workflows explicitly set permissions](https://github.com/mindersec/minder-rules-and-profiles/blob/main/rule-types/github/actions_check_default_permissions.yaml)
